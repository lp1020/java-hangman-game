# Java-Hangman-Game

## Technologies Used
* Core Java

## Process/Approach
I made a hangman game when I started learning JavaScript and it's a game I always enjoyed playing, so I was interested in how it could be created in Java.
I planned out the structure of the game and all the main functions I would need in order to implement and play the game, along with the classes and helper functions I needed to use.
I tried to anticipate the problems I would face, primarily the notion of Strings being immutable in Java. I researched how to get around this problem,
as well as any other foreseen challenges I might face while trying to implement the game.

## Installation Instructions
This game is run and played in the console, so the only installation needed is a Java IDE. I used IntelliJ to create the game.

## Unsolved Problems
The only problem I am still facing is storing more than one game result in my game history. Each game I'm running is initializing a new 
game class, so I'm still looking into how I would store multiple game results in my history array lists.

## Biggest wins/challenges
My biggest wins were also my biggest challenges, in that there were several addons I had to research to make the game work the way I wanted it to.
For example, using fileReader and bufferedReader to use an external word list, as well as using a StringBuilder type in order to mutate the strings all took 
me the longest time to research and implement.
